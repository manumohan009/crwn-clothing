REDUX

3 principles
    1. Single source of truth
    2. State is read only - immutability
    3. Changes using pure functions

Action -> Rooot Reducer -> Store -> DOM Changes
    - In redux we make sure that all the actions flows through one reducer function;
    - As reducer function is a pure function, it returns the same state based on the action and updates the store
    - FLUX pattern
        Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View
        unidirectional data flow
    - MVC pattern
        Action -> Controller -> Model -> View
                             -> Model -> View

    The reducer alwalys return a new state object; because, only then React re-renders the component
    Middlewares are functions that receives the action objects before it reaches the reducer

    connect is a HOC that modifies our component to have access to redux
