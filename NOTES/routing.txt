react-routing-dom

BrowserRouter, Switch, Route

3 props passed into a component
    - history
        - push
    - location
    - match
        - url - to which it actually matched
        - path - the whole path
        - params - url parmameters

3 ways to navigate using react-router-dom
    1. Link
        <Link to='/topics'>Topic</Link>
    2. history props
        <button onClick={()=>props.history.push('/topics')}>Topics</button>
    3. location
        - location.pathname - gives you the exact pathlocation; full url
        - allows us to build a nested route structure using match


withRouter()
    - we get access to the history and other props only to one level of children
    - withRouter is HOC - it is a function that takes a component as a argument and returns a modified component
